data: "positive" and "negative"
Using the observe_function on the video to obtain the time series. The observe_function is to sum the gray values of all pixels in each picture.
We consider two cases, one is to do inter frame difference first and then use observation function, and the other is to directly use observation function.
We use sliding window embedding to reconstruct the geometric space of time series.
